# Flatacuties

An app for voting for the cutest animal.
 I will be using a local API and building out the frontend for our app, Flatacuties.


## Setup

Run this command to get the backend started:

```sh
json-server --watch db.json
```

Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:
ters
[http://localhost:3000/charac]

Then, open the `index.html` file on your browser to run the application.


All flatacuties are spanned in a `span` tag upon clicking on the animal it should appear on the  image box.

you  can add votes to the animal of your choice.

a reset button is used to reset the casted votes.

total votes of the animal are displayed
